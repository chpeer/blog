Welcome to my blog.

This is a first test on putting together the basics for a new website, which includes a blog. Why? Well - the old website is .... you guessed it - old. It served me for 10 years - much has happened - much has changes. So it's time for a new one.

Oh and why the blog? Well honestly - I'm not so good in writing, so should work on that. But also, I want to use this blog to document how i build things, so I can easily recreate it later on. Yes, I can do that in a private page somewhere, ofc - but well - i thought maybe it is of use and help to someone else as well
